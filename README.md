## Project Topic
Donut TC™ is a leader in Thailand in the manufacture of handmade donuts. Our donuts are made with the best flours and fillings. Donut TC™ is for its customers the assurance of a gourmet experience throughout the country, with donuts of extreme freshness.  But what could be more infuriating than to go to a store to buy something, and then have to leave empty-handed due to a lack of stock?We  want  to  set  up  an  innovative  service  for  our  customers,  at  the  crossroads  of  the  e-Shop  and  the  drive-in.  This  service,  called  "Donuts  on  Demand»  (DoD),  will  allow customers to make their selection from our range of donuts, place their order and specify the date and time they will pick them up.Ordering on Donuts on Demand ensures that you always get your favorite cookie recipe, right out of the oven, on time. No more queues in the store, no more unpleasant surprises such  as  chocolate  being  out  of  stock.  Donuts  always  fresh,  available  in  less  than  two hours and recovered while still hot for even more gourmet family moments
